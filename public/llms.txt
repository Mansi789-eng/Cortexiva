# Cortexiva - AI-Powered Knowledge Bots

> Knowledge bots that stay fresh. Built for teams who hate outdated docs.

## What is Cortexiva?

Cortexiva is a platform for creating AI-powered knowledge bots that help teams access information instantly. Instead of searching through wikis, Slack threads, or asking colleagues, teams can query a bot that understands their documentation.

## Key Features

- **Always Fresh Knowledge**: Auto-sync with your tools. When docs update, your bot learns instantly.
- **Department-Ready Templates**: Pre-built templates for HR, Sales, Engineering, Support.
- **24+ Integrations** (Coming Soon): Connect Slack, Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, GitHub.
- **Instant Answers**: Sub-second response times.
- **100% EU Data Residency**: All data stays in the European Union. GDPR compliant.

## Use Cases

1. **HR Teams**: Employee self-service for policy questions, handbook queries, benefits info.
2. **Support Teams**: Instant access to product docs, troubleshooting guides.
3. **Engineering Teams**: Onboard new developers with instant answers from codebase docs.

## How It Works

1. Connect your data sources (Notion, Google Drive, upload files)
2. Customize your bot (tone, guardrails, access control)
3. Share & deploy (link, Slack embed, website widget)
